# Walmart Stock Price Prediction Project

This project forecasts the closing price of Walmart (WMT) stock for the year 2025 using time series analysis. The analysis utilizes historical stock data and the ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) model to generate predictions.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict the future stock price of Walmart based on its past performance. The analysis involves the following steps:

1.  **Data Loading and Preprocessing:** Loading historical Walmart stock data from a CSV file and preparing it for time series analysis, including setting the date as the index.
2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing the stock price trends, moving averages, and Bollinger Bands to understand the data's characteristics and potential trading signals.
3.  **ARIMA Modeling:** Applying the ARIMA model to the closing price data from 2024 to learn the underlying patterns.
4.  **Forecasting:** Using the fitted ARIMA model to predict the closing prices for the year 2025.
5.  **Visualization:** Creating a time series plot showing the actual closing prices (historical and 2024) alongside the forecasted closing prices for 2025, including confidence intervals to represent the uncertainty of the predictions.

## Files

* `wmt_data.csv`: This file contains the historical Walmart stock price data used for the analysis.

## Libraries Used

* `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
* `matplotlib`: For creating visualizations.
* `statsmodels`: For time series analysis, specifically the ARIMA model.

## Visualizations

The project includes the following key visualizations:

* **Walmart Stock Price and Moving Averages:** Shows the closing price of Walmart stock along with the 50-day and 200-day moving averages.
* **Bollinger Bands for Walmart:** Displays the closing price with upper and lower Bollinger Bands, indicating potential overbought or oversold conditions.
* **Walmart Trading Signals:** Highlights potential buy and sell signals based on the closing price crossing the Bollinger Bands.
* **Walmart Trading Signals - 2024 (Cleaner Version):** Focuses on the trading signals generated in the year 2024.
* **Walmart Stock Price Prediction for 2025:** Presents the actual closing prices for 2024 and the forecasted closing prices for 2025.
* **Walmart Stock Price Prediction for 2025 with Confidence Intervals:** Shows the actual closing prices, the forecasted prices for 2025, and the 95% confidence intervals around the forecast, representing the range of likely future prices.

## Model

The ARIMA model (with order (5, 1, 0) in the provided code) was used for forecasting. The parameters (p, d, q) of the ARIMA model were chosen based on the characteristics of the 2024 stock price data. Further analysis and model selection techniques (like ACF and PACF plots, and model diagnostics) could be employed to optimize the ARIMA model order for potentially more accurate forecasts.

## Results

The final visualization (`walmart_stock_predict_2025_ci.png`) provides a forecast for the Walmart stock price in 2025, along with a 95% confidence interval. This interval indicates the range within which the actual stock price is likely to fall with a 95% probability, based on the historical patterns learned by the ARIMA model from the 2024 data. The forecast suggests a general trend for 2025, but the widening confidence intervals further into the future highlight the increasing uncertainty inherent in longer-term stock price predictions.

## Further Work

* Optimize the ARIMA model order using techniques like AIC or BIC.
* Explore other time series forecasting models (e.g., SARIMA, Prophet).
* Incorporate external factors (e.g., market sentiment, economic indicators) into the model.
* Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) on a hold-out dataset.
* Backtest the trading signals generated by the Bollinger Bands strategy.
